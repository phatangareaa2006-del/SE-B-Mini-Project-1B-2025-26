## ðŸ› ï¸ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Flutter SDK** (version 3.0 or higher)
   - Download from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   - Add Flutter to your system PATH

2. **Android Studio** (for Android development)
   - Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Install Android SDK and emulator

3. **VS Code** (recommended) with Flutter extension
   - Or use Android Studio with Flutter plugin

4. **Django Backend** must be running
   - The Django REST API should be running on `http://localhost:8000`

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Step 1: Install Flutter

**For Windows:**
```powershell
# Download Flutter SDK from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows
# Extract to C:\src\flutter
# Add C:\src\flutter\bin to PATH

# Verify installation
flutter doctor
```

**For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Download Flutter SDK
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"

# Verify installation
flutter doctor
```

### Step 2: Setup Project

1. Navigate to the Flutter app directory:
```powershell
cd D:\git\AgroAssist\agro_assist_app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```powershell
flutter pub get
```

This will download all required packages:
- `http`: For API communication with Django
- `provider`: For state management
- `intl`: For date formatting
- `shared_preferences`: For local storage

### Step 3: Configure API URL

Set API URL using `--dart-define` when launching Flutter:

```powershell
# Chrome / local web
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

# Android emulator
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000/api

# Physical device (replace with your computer IP)
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.5:8000/api
```

**To find your computer's IP address:**
- Windows: `ipconfig` (look for IPv4 Address)
- macOS/Linux: `ifconfig` or `ip addr`

### Step 4: Start Django Backend

Make sure your Django backend is running:

```powershell
cd D:\git\AgroAssist
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

The `0.0.0.0:8000` allows connections from other devices on the network (including emulator/physical device).

### Step 5: Run Flutter App

**Option 1: Android Emulator**
```powershell
# Start Android emulator from Android Studio
# Or from command line:
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>

# Run the app
flutter run
```

**Option 2: Physical Device**
1. Enable Developer Mode on your phone
2. Enable USB Debugging
3. Connect phone via USB
4. Run: `flutter run`

**Option 3: Chrome (Web)**
```powershell
flutter run -d chrome
```

## ðŸ› Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Failed to load crops" error

**Solution:**
1. Check if Django backend is running: `http://localhost:8000/api/crops/`
